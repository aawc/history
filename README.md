# history

Longterm bash history with advanced search and select.

Manages a comprehensive history file that
allows searching and rerunning commands according to
executed command, working directory, time run, user, or host.


## Usage

* **h**[!] [*CONTEXT*] [*TIMESPEC*] [--] [*SEARCH*]...
  * Search history for pattern
* **dh**[!] [*CONTEXT*] [*TIMESPEC*] [--] [*SEARCH*]...
  * Show history of commands in this directory and subdirectories and optionally filter with pattern
* **ldh**[!] [*CONTEXT*] [*TIMESPEC*] [--] [*SEARCH*]...
  * Show history of commands in this directory only and optionally filter with pattern

### SEARCH
SEARCH matches the executed command.
It is interpreted as a `gawk` regular expression.
Multiple SEARCH arguments are joined with `.*`.

### TIMESPEC
TIMESPEC matches the timestamp and
is an argument of the form "[START..END]", (note the square brackets).
START and END are strings understood by `date`.
A single day may be specified by "[DATE]".

### CONTEXT
CONTEXT is an argument of the form "*USER*@*HOST*:*DIRECTORY*"
or "*USER*@*HOST*::*DIRECTORY*", where each field is optional.
"@" is used to specify user or host filters.
A ":" is used to specify a directory filter,
while "::" may be used instead to exclude subdirectories.

### !
All three commands allow selecting from the 10 most recent entries
matching the filters by adding `!` to the command (ex. `h!`).
The selected command may be edited before it is executed.

The following command is also provided:

* **cd!** * [*CONTEXT*] [*TIMESPEC*] [--] [*SEARCH*]
  * Select from recent working directories and optionally filter with pattern

### Examples
